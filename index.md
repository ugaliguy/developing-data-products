## A Basic Shiny App

We built a Shiny app that looks at a subset of the Chicago Transit Authority's  'L' Station Entries - Daily Totals data set. The full set has over 790,000 rows.  We looked at the subset consisting of Red Line stations for the year 2015.

The full data set can be found [here](https://data.cityofchicago.org/Transportation/CTA-Ridership-L-Station-Entries-Daily-Totals/5neh-572f).

## Using the App

We can do the following with our app, which can be found [here](https://ugaliguy.shinyapps.io/shiny-app/).  

The source code can be found [here](https://github.com/ugaliguy/Coursera-Data-Science/tree/master/Developing-Data-Products).

### Table

* Look at the number of passengers on a given day
* Look at the number of passengers at a given station
* Reorder the columns of the table

### Statistics

* Plot the number of passengers at a particular station for the year 2015
* Observe trends in ridership with respect to the day of the week.
